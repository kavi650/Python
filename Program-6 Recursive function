factorial of a number 


def factorial(n):
    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        # Recursive case
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Taking input from the user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Checking for negative input
if num < 0:
    print("Factorial does not exist for negative numbers.")
else:
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}")
